<p>Pasha made a name for himself after the release of his first showreel <i class="fas fa-video"></i> in May 2009 <br> which showcased many original moves. His creative and innovative take on freerunning has made him a master of urban spaces – the Latvian is always looking to create new tricks and has surprised his fans with his training methods</p>

<div class="grid-item txttwo">
<p>His dedication and originality make him one of the strongest freerunners in the world. Pasha has picked up two <a href="#Links">Red Bull Art of Motion</a> titles and come very close to taking a third victory on Santorini Island. But for Pasha, it’s not all about the wins – he says that freerunning gives him everything that he wants in life – fun, food and friends</p>
